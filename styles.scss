 * Responsive Styles
 *
 * Styles for a new responsive template, to be rolled out across
 * the website sooner or later.
 *
 * These styles were originally developed by Justin McDowell. They
 * set up a mobile-first website that expands to three, then seven
 * columns as the browser width increases. The baseline is set at
 * 15 pixels.
 *
 * Styles in this file are organized according to the SMACSS
 * principles: http://smacss.com/
